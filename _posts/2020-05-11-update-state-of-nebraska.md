title:  "'FATtening' the Curve? Buck Up Nebraskans."

First of all, let's look at the updated chart of total cases from the daily tracking of cases by the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. On the top is the chart from today, and under it is the chart from last week.

Here's an animation that goes back and forth between last week and this week, making the difference more obvious:

Anyone see any "flattening" there? Hmm...

#### Chart from Axios.com

The following chart is from [Axios](https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-caseloads-states-b24899a3-286e-4ea9-bd71-0e88ed645e68.html). It shows the weekly change in the number of new cases of Covid, by state. Note that two states, Nebraska and Minnesota, are dark brown. Dark brown's the worst. It means the cases are growing at more than 50% per week.

Mathematicians call 50% growth per week "exponential growth." Invest $100 at 50% growth per week, and after one year, you'll have 143 billion dollars.

This chart above is from the week of April 27 through May 4. Oh, wasn't that the week when the Governor and Omaha's mayor declared that we had "flattened the curve" and could re-open the state?

I'll post the current week's chart when it becomes available.

#### Miscellaneous Thoughts for the Week

**Justification for "opening up."** Did you notice, in the local news, whether any enterprising journalist called the Mayor's office and asked for the specific reports, charts, etc., that proved that we had flattened the curve and could re-open? I'm not talking about a Mayor's representative simply declaring that "Douglas County told us"; what about the actual data, figures, statistical evaluations, so we can see, too, so an independent knowledgeable person can agree or disagree with the Mayor's assessment? Anyone interested in finding that?

**The six foot rule**. Let's talk about the six foot rule a bit. The six foot rule does help, some. The rule is to be used when you must be around other people. For example, we don't have a way to get food to every household without going to the grocery store, so since you must go to the grocery store, stay six feet from other people. Many more of us are taking walks in the parks now. Staying six feet away from other walkers is helpful, and courteous as well.

But the six foot rule isn't total protection; it's just something you can do when you have no other options. Best is not to have to invoke the six foot rule at all: if you don't have to be someplace, don't go! I'm not going to a restaurant, even if the restaurant management is being conscientious about the six foot rule. I'd still be spending an hour or more in a room with lots of other people breathing the same air, plates being taken back to the kitchen. The fact that we're all six feet from each other doesn't prevent the virus from spreading among us.

Workout clubs are re-opening. Have you seen me on the StairMaster? Panting and wheezing and dripping? You want to be on the adjacent machine for an hour, even if it's six feet away from me? When the whole room is full of people doing the same thing I'm doing? Really?

**Another reason to flatten the curve**. Remember this chart, showing the number of people who have the virus at any given time:

If we flatten the curve, we don't overwhelm the health care system, but even so, we will all get the virus, eventually. If you're one of the people who's destined to do poorly from Covid, you will do poorly when you get it, whenever that happens.

But if we can truly flatten the curve, some of us might last without infection until the scientists come up with a vaccination. Then, something like this can happen to the chart:

(chart not numerically rigorous.)

The number of people with the virus gets chopped off when an effective vaccination is widely available. If you can hold out until the vaccination comes, you might not have to get the virus at all. You won't have to worry that you or your spouse or your child will be the one who fits into that small mortality percentage. But if we don't pay attention to social distancing (and later testing and contact tracing), we let the virus hit everyone sooner, and the eventual vaccine will help far fewer people than it otherwise could.
