Hi again, Ms. _____,

Okay, you asked in your email whether there's anything we're missing. You mentioned [Mr. Cordes's article](https://www.omaha.com/livewellnebraska/nebraskas-coronavirus-peak-was-projected-to-arrive-by-now-but-its-probably-still-coming/article_73bc8f3d-d24d-59ae-9e38-acf9a2e0716e.html), but I'll speak in general about the topic, and reference Mr. Cordes's article here and there.

I'll list the failures for you, and explain them clearly. I hope you find time to read this entire "email" page. I promise, you will understand these issues **much** better than **anyone** else at the paper, guaranteed.

Here's what we're missing:

1) we have a failure of the state's leadership and our media to **teach** us what's important and why,

2) we have a failure to **do** what we need to do, which is partly the failure of our leadership not only to educate us, but to rally us to this important task,

3) we have a leadership that is not partnering with us and protecting us, but rather prevaricating and deceiving us at every turn, in order to give some of us what we want, rather than to give all of us what we need.

4) we have a failure of our local and state journalism, to detect and call out these prevarications, and hold our leaders accountable, for the protection of all of us.

Whew. That's a mouthful. Let's get started. (Pardon me if I quote liberally from the CovidNE.com site that I set up.)

Please, if my tone seems a bit hot, it doesn't reflect on my words' accuracy. Governor Ricketts has been intentionally gaslighting the State. It's unconscionable. These are life and death decisions for thousands of Nebraskans that he's making, and he's lying to us about how he's making the decisions. At least from the time of the [April 25th article](https://www.omaha.com/news/state_and_regional/ricketts-easing-nebraska-coronavirus-restrictions-as-of-may-4-limited-reopening-of-economy/article_2abb7fce-5ca5-54d8-8ab0-1b968ff2aa1a.html) that I linked to on CovidNE, he's been saying -- read carefully -- that the fact that our hospitals are not overwhelmed with Covid patients means that we have "flattened the curve," and thus we are justified in opening the state. The exact exact opposite is the truth, but nobody (except you and I) understands that, because people just aren't good with charts and numbers.

Let's go back to the "flattening the curve" chart, and understand Ricketts's lies.

With strict social distancing, we can follow the blue curve. That's "flattening the curve." It means that we might all still get the virus eventually (barring a vaccine), but we're not spreading it around rapidly, so it spreads a little at a time, and the number of people with the virus at any one time stays low. We have a better chance of protecting those of us who would do poorly with the virus.

Above, in yellow, if we decline social distancing, the number of people with the virus spikes early and powerfully, and we overwhelm our health care system. Doctors have to turn away patients who could be saved, because there simply isn't room for them in the hospitals. We don't give the scientists a chance to get us a vaccine -- we all just get the virus right away.

Let's see what's going on in Nebraska right now.

![](http://covidne.com/CovidCurves_5g_2_JulieAnderson_1.jpg)

Above, we are on the red curve. There has been zero "flattening" of the curve.

Now this is an absolutely crucial point: Ricketts keeps saying, over and over, that **since the hospitals aren't overwhelmed**, we have flattened the curve and can release social distancing.

That statement is a falsehood. In fact, the hospitals have not been overwhelmed **because we haven't gotten enough cases to overwhelm them yet**. We are riding on the red line above, but we are only up to the tip of the green arrow so far. **That's** why we have not "overwhelmed" the intensive care units. We are NOT following the blue curve. Ricketts knows this. He says something that sounds reasonable-ish, but it's intentionally false.

In this context, the hospital censuses have **nothing** to do with whether the curve has been flattened. It is not a matter of opinion; it is not a matter of different ways to look at the same data. It is false that the non-overwhelmed hospitals indicate any flattening of the curve.

Ricketts knew this on April 25th when he announced the May 4th relaxation of restrictions. He knew this on May 9th when Mr. Cordes wrote his article. We have always been on an exponential growth curve.

Now, of course, one never really knows what someone else is thinking, so let me temper my statement that Ricketts knew he was lying to us. I'll say, either he knew he was gaslighting us, or he was outrageously, criminally irresponsible to make a decision of this magnitude, this consequence, while knowing nothing of the issues involved, and not getting scientists to advise him in order to inform his decisions. I'm unable to see a conclusion other than that he had the intention to open the state no matter what, and this hospital business is the "reason" he came up with. Very very few people would see and understand the fallacy with his reasoning, and thus he wouldn't be questioned. It worked.

Now back to Mr. Cordes's article.

Nebraska leads the nation in percentage growth in new confirmed cases. That's true over the past week, the past two weeks and the past month, according to a World-Herald analysis of national data.

Nebraska, which a month earlier was averaging 44 new cases a day, during the past week was adding about 440 a day.

Douglas County, which was rarely topping 10 new cases a day as recently as two or three weeks ago, has been averaging 84 new cases daily since April 30. Lancaster County, which only once before April 26 exceeded 10 cases in a day, since then has topped that number every day but one, with a single-day high of 64 on Monday.

All those terrible numbers, and:

Ricketts on Friday declined to say whether he thinks the state has peaked.

Are we living in reality? Could he possibly think we have peaked? A couple of days ago, NBC News got hold of an unreleased White House report on the virus, which release reported that Nebraska was in the report's "red" zone, with a 40%-per-week growth rate.

Regardless of whether Nebraska has peaked, no one is saying the state has seen a sustained reduction in cases -- something public health officials have recommended as a condition for states to lift restrictions.

But Ricketts opens the state anyway. I know, I know, I know, the article was not an opinion piece. And I don't know your business enough to know where and whether analysis belongs in a report-what-happened article. But what is the intelligent, careful reader of the article supposed to do with these contradictions?

Now let's pivot and look at Mayor Stothert. On Friday, May 1st, three days before the relaxation of social distancing was to go into effect, Mayor Stothert [spoke to the press](https://www.omaha.com/news/local/health-director-its-time-to-relax-rules-in-omaha-metro-as-people-are-becoming-fatigued/article_035476e2-e3f6-58b3-8cea-5e6d042958ad.html) with  Douglas County Health Department Director Adi Pour, Ph.D. The linked article presented:

"Even with coronavirus infections trending upward in Omaha and Nebraska, the time is right to relax some restrictions because local hospitals have enough capacity to treat patients and **because people are becoming fatigued and are not following all the regulations anymore**," Douglas County Health Director Adi Pour said Friday.

So she **stated** that we have not "flattened the curve." She stated that we are relaxing restrictions because we're tired of them, and because we're not following them anyway. Oh, okay. Should your diabetic cousin stop taking her insulin injections because she's tired of them? Clearly, life-and-death decisions are not being made on the basis of science. Aren't you ready to scream? Do we have to put up with this?

That said, [Dr. Pour] urged everyone to "be careful in these next two weeks."

Pardon, but what does that mean? Are we supposed to go to the restaurant or not? Sounds like she is trying to salvage her credibility while not angering the Mayor.

The Mayor then **directly contradicted** her Health Department Director.

Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert said the initial tight restrictions had worked to flatten the curve in Nebraska.

Of course, it was not pointed out in the article that the Mayor had directly contradicted her Director. We just ingest the "news," without digesting it. And Mayor Stothert could not be more wrong. Dr. Pour's charts from Douglas County are accurate. In no universe have we flattened the curve.

Shall we take a look at one of Dr. Pour's charts?

![](http://covidne.com/NebrCases_May_11_2020_2flat_aJulie.jpg)

Covid cases in Nebraska. The lower yellow arrow is the date that Ricketts announced that we had flattened the curve and could now re-open the state. The upper yellow curve is the date that Mayor Stothert announced that we had flattened the curve and could now re-open the city.

And now back to Mr. Cordes's article, a quotation from the scientist, Dr. Mark Rupp:

"Clearly we are not seeing the declining rates that would make us all breathe a lot easier and say now is the time to relax things," Rupp said.

But at the same time, Rupp said he's not faulting Ricketts or local public health officials for decisions to loosen restrictions. The impact on the economy is real. And some degree of "quarantine fatigue" is settling in among the public, he said.

"These decisions are extremely complex and very difficult," Rupp said.

I do not know Dr. Rupp. But I'm sorry, these are not the words of a scientist telling you the science. These are not the words I would say. These sound like the words of someone under pressure from the political class to conform to a foregone decision that was made without the benefit of science.

Ms. ____, we have to see all this deception as what it is. We are too old and too experienced to gaslight ourselves.

What I really think is that, if the Mayor and the Governor are going to hyper-accelerate the rate of death in this State, they should just say, "Unfortunately we are on an exponential curve, an explosion of virus cases. But we just don't intend to keep the social restrictions in place. People want their parties and their haircuts. So we are going to defy the science and open up." Or, they should sit down with the press and present the "hard data" (as Ricketts called it) that proved that we had flattened the curve. They should take responsibility. They won't of course, and that's where the intelligent public hopes for journalism to pressure our leaders to take responsibility and explain their actions. If that arena isn't not part of your personal bread and butter, could you show this "email" to someone whose practice is more on the investigative side?

My 94-year-old father is in a nursing home. I mean, he **was**. We brought him home a week ago, specifically to get him out of the nursing home, specifically because Ricketts and Stothert had denied science. The nursing home was doing everything they could, following all regulations, but they have forty employees who come to work, and then another forty on the next shift. Someone is going to bring the virus to the nursing home, and you know what happens then. New York State, the state with the most deaths, just reported that about half of all the deaths were among nursing home residents. Ricketts's actions will spread the virus much faster among our community, and inevitably bring the virus to the nursing home much faster.

Workout clubs have re-opened. But it's okay, the six-foot rule, someone protests! You should see me on the StairMaster. Panting and wheezing and dripping. You want to be on the adjacent machine for an hour, even if it's six feet away from me? When the whole room is full of people doing the same thing I'm doing?

Many people are not wise; they need wise leadership from their leaders, and we are not getting it. We are getting deception and caving to business forces who want to be doing business as usual. Nursing homes and their dear residents be damned.

Dare I go on?

Ricketts again used a speed limit analogy Friday when asked why Nebraska is moving ahead now. He said the state could eliminate nearly all traffic fatalities on the Interstate if it was willing to reduce the speed limit to 5 mph. Now that it's clear the virus is not overwhelming the capacity of the health care system, he said, it's time to ease up on the economic brakes.

Words fail me here. Speeding limits. The bobble-heads nod. People are mollified. And when a month from now we're the world Covid hot spot, it will just be unfortunate unavoidable circumstances. Not any fault of our leaders, no. It's the virus, after all. Descended on us. Nothing we could do.

Ms. ______, this is the most important situation to hit our state, our country, in decades. We are learning more and more about national overall mortality rates, which are closing in on a fairly-well-defined 0.5 percent. That figure means that ten thousand Nebraskans will die. Somebody's dad, mom, wife, daughter. All of those deaths a disaster, an unfathomable number.

Please pause, and indulge me while I try a different metaphor on for size. World War II. During that war, about four or five thousand Nebraskans died. In the same ballpark as the expected outcome of the virus. What ever happened to us working together, rolling up our sleeves against a common enemy, doing what it takes, rationing, factories, Rosie the riveter? A new WWII monument was just unveiled in Memorial Park, across the street from my house. Here's a detail, a soldier saying goodbye to his children as he heads off to war. Made me cry this morning when I took this photo, on a walk with my son, about the same age as the boy in the sculpture.

![](http://covidne.com/WWII_Memorial_1_400.jpg)

My dad said that he and his friends couldn't **wait** to enlist. I have to think that being given a gun and dropped into a wet field in Germany, or being landed on a beach in France, was somewhat more inconvenient than not being able to get a new hairstyle or go to the Playhouse. But they went, because of leadership. The leadership explained to them why it mattered, so far away, and what they had to do. And they went. Are we really that feeble now?

Okay, deep breath. Interlude over.

There are many other countries that did the necessary work, and truly flattened the curve, and now are doing controlled relaxation of distancing requirements, with the virus at a low level, awaiting an eventual vaccination.

We have the opportunity to save some Nebraskan's lives, or at least to know why they are being lost. We are not being led with honor and honesty by our elected officials. We should demand honor and honesty when they are allocating street repair funds. If we are unable to demand it in **this** situation, then what worth are we? Who will take the lead on this?

Someone needs to hold these two elected leaders accountable. We need to **see** the "hard data" that Ricketts talked about. We need to **see** the papers that Mayor Stothert had spread out over her desk when she nodded and agreed that we had flattened the curve. Or they should admit that they made those decisions without data. They need to come clean and face us and tell us what is going on, who and what facts are influencing their decisions and why.

One more look at the curves, accentuating what a "flattened" curve looks like:

![](http://covidne.com/CovidCurves_5g_2_JulieAnderson_2.jpg)

The red line is where we are. The black line is a flattened curve. There is no mistaking the difference. This page has numerous quotes about how Nebraska is exploding with virus, be we're relaxing restrictions. The result of relaxing restrictions cannot be to move us from the red curve to the black. It will push the red curve up to a higher angle.
