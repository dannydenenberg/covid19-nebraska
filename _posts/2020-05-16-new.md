#### Introduction

To understand what's happening in Nebraska, first we must really understand the "flatten the curve" chart that you've been seeing everywhere.

Let's start at the beginning. The yellow curve below shows how many people have the virus, assuming we just let the virus spread without trying to slow the spread -- without social distancing. As we move to the right, we go from month to month, and as the curve climbs higher, more and more people have the virus:

Without good social distancing, the curve showing the number of people who have the virus shoots upward, the infectious virus spreading rapidly.

Below: the grey horizontal line represents the limit of how many sick people our health system can care for at one time:

The hospitals don't have infinite capacity. If more people are sick than that horizontal line -- in other words, as the yellow peak rises above the horizontal line -- then your loved one might arrive at the hospital, unable to breathe, desperately needing a room in intensive care with a ventilator, but the hospital says, "Sorry, all full. We simply can't help you."

Below: the blue curve shows how many people have the virus at a particular time if we make strong efforts to slow the spread of the virus -- social distancing:

Closing the schools, sporting events, you know the drill. If we all work together to slow the spread of the virus, the number of people who have the virus at any one time stays lower, along the blue curve. It never overwhelms the health care system, and your loved one doesn't have to die because there was no place to care for him. That's what they mean by "flattening the curve": pushing down the yellow curve with social distancing to match the blue curve instead.

#### Nebraska Right Now

Now let's look at the current state of affairs in Nebraska. The chart below is from May 4, 2020, showing the number of positive Covid cases in the state, from early March through today. The chart was plucked from the [daily tracking of cases by the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services](https://nebraska.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/4213f719a45647bc873ffb58783ffef3):

The trajectory of the chart is horrifying:

We have this terrible situation, despite our (incomplete) efforts so far to socially distance and curb the spread of the virus. Seems to me we need to work harder!

#### Our Officials

On April 24, Governor Pete Ricketts [announced](https://www.omaha.com/news/state_and_regional/ricketts-easing-nebraska-coronavirus-restrictions-as-of-may-4-limited-reopening-of-economy/article_2abb7fce-5ca5-54d8-8ab0-1b968ff2aa1a.html) that Nebraska would be relaxing its social distancing restrictions: people can go to restaurants, religious services, hair salons, etc.

Quoting from the linked article:

[Ricketts said the decision] was based on "hard data" that hospitals and intensive care units are not being swamped, and not on pressure to reopen the economy. "If we're not overwhelming our health care system, we're winning," Ricketts said.

Below, we see the current Nebraska Covid cases chart again, with a white arrow showing the date Governor Ricketts made his statement:

Now that you understand the charts, you see that Governor Ricketts's assessment is mistaken, and his actions are misguided. Health officials all over the world claim that restrictions can't safely be relaxed until the curve is "flattened." Does it look to you as though we had flattened our curve on April 24th when the Governor made the announcement? No, we are on an upward rocket of a growth trajectory. Below, I've plucked part of the yellow-and-blue-curve chart, and I've placed a red arrow at Nebraska's approximate location on the chart today:

(This overlay is intended to demonstrate where on the curve we are, not to be numerically rigorous.)

We are at the tip of the red arrow. We are riding on that yellow curve. The Governor relaxed restrictions because "we're not overwhelming our health care system."  But we haven't overwhelmed the health care system because we don't have enough cases to hit the horizontal grey line yet, not because we've flattened the curve.

We're on a trajectory to blast through the grey health care line, and relaxing restrictions will accelerate the pace greatly.

On Friday, May 1st, three days before the relaxation of social distancing was to go into effect, Douglas County Health Department Director Adi Pour, Ph.D., [spoke to the press](https://www.omaha.com/news/local/health-director-its-time-to-relax-rules-in-omaha-metro-as-people-are-becoming-fatigued/article_035476e2-e3f6-58b3-8cea-5e6d042958ad.html) with Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert. Let's examine what the linked article presented:

"Even with coronavirus infections trending upward in Omaha and Nebraska, the time is right to relax some restrictions because local hospitals have enough capacity to treat patients and **because people are becoming fatigued and are not following all the regulations anymore**," Douglas County Health Director Adi Pour said Friday.

So we are not relaxing restrictions because we have flattened the curve. We have relaxed restrictions because we're tired of them, and because we're not following them anyway. Should your diabetic cousin stop taking her insulin injections because she's tired of them? Clearly, life-and-death decisions are not being made on the basis of science. I hope that bothers the scientist, Dr. Pour. It should bother us, too.

That said, [Dr. Pour] urged everyone to "be careful in these next two weeks."

Pardon, but what does that mean? Are we supposed to go to the restaurant or not?

Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert said the initial tight restrictions had worked to flatten the curve in Nebraska.

Mayor Stothert could not be more wrong. The charts from Douglas County are accurate. In no universe have we flattened the curve.

Pour said she is very concerned about churches resuming services. "My advice would be if you are vulnerable, you are at high risk," Pour said. "... I would prefer individuals who are elderly, have underlying illnesses, ... that those individuals stay at home."

So why did the Governor open church services?

The easing of the restrictions comes as the number of cases is surging in Douglas County.

There is no logic to easing restrictions as the number of cases is surging.

#### Conclusion

We are not being governed by science in Nebraska. We should not be easing restrictions: if anything, we should be tightening them.

Where do we go from here? I'll continue to post the virus prevalence charts. Let's see what happens...
